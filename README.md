# Rule Induction System

A desktop application for generating decision rules from distributed data using Rough Set Theory and the RM (Reduct and Majority) heuristic.

## ðŸ§  About the Project

This project was developed as part of my engineering thesis at the University of Silesia in Sosnowiec.  
The main goal is to extract consistent and minimal-length decision rules from binary decision tables.

The application supports:
- Loading multiple CSV files with binary decision tables
- Generating decision rules based on the RM heuristic
- Optimizing rules by minimizing condition length
- Calculating and exporting rule statistics

## ðŸ“Œ Technologies Used

- **Java 17**
- **Java Swing** â€“ GUI
- **Java IO / Streams API** â€“ data processing
- **Git** â€“ version control


## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dg-creator/RuleInductionSystem.git
   
2. Open the project in IntelliJ or any Java IDE.
3. Run Main.java.

ðŸ“Š Example Output

Average rule length: 3.6
Average rule support: 52.9
Unique rules: 80
